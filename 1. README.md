This workflow turns raw RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) data into a table showing gene activity. 

RNA-seq reads are downloaded from a public database and checked for quality using FastQC, with MultiQC summarizing the results. 

The reads are then aligned to the human reference genome (GRCh38) using RNA STAR. After alignment, featureCounts counts how many reads map to each gene using a gene annotation file. Finally, results from all samples are combined into one clean gene expression dataset that can be used for further analysis.

Entire workflow executed in Galaxy, No custom scripts required
Dataset contains only tumor samples
Tool versions recorded in Galaxy histories


**This project is to explore galaxy as a tool research and educational purposes only, idea to explore galaxy came from https://galaxyproject.org/events/gcc2026/highlights/** 
It started when recceived email Welcome to the 2026 Galaxy Community Conference
